# RandomJokes
App that displays random jokes about someone in the user's contacts list

# Why
This project represent my experiment with the VIP pattern and the Repository pattern. I couldn't have come up with such a silly idea, so I have to thank my collegue Daniele that encouraged and inspired me to do this ðŸ˜‚

# How
Thanks to ["The Internet Chuck Norris Database"](http://www.icndb.com/api/) for the huge database of jokes ðŸ’ª
